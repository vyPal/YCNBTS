You Can Never Be Too Secure

A fun little project experimenting with encryption and cryptography.

The main goal is to make a realy simple yet really secure chat application.

## Stuff that is already implemented:
- [x] Relay server (+ discovery)
- [x] Simple client
- [x] RSA for key exchange
- [x] AES256-GCM for message encryption

## Ideas I might implement
- [ ] RSA key rotation
- [ ] Communication over ToR network
- [ ] Some post-quantum encryption algorithm
